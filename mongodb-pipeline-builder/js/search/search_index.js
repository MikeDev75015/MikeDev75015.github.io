Instead, first define the variables for the input\ndocument fields, and then reference the variables in the stages in the pipeline.\nNOTE\nTo reference variables in pipeline stages, use the \"$$\" syntax.\nThe let variables can be accessed by the stages in the pipeline, including additional $lookup stages nested in\nthe pipeline.\nA $match stage requires the use of an $expr operator to access the variables. $expr allows the use of aggregation\nexpressions inside of the $match syntax.\nWithout the use of the $expr operator, $match can refer to fields in a document but cannot access variables\ndefined by a $lookup let clause.\nThe $expr operator only uses indexes on the from collection for equality matches. Non-equality match queries,\nsuch as range queries, cannot use indexes on the from collection.\nOther (non-$match) stages in the pipeline do not require an $expr operator to access the variables.\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        pipeline\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        pipeline:         StageInterface[]\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         StageInterface[]\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    Specifies the pipeline to run on the joined collection.

Field or fields that act as a unique identifier for a document. The identifier determines if a results\ndocument matches an already existing document in the output collection. Specify either:\nA single field name as a string. For example:\non: \"_id\"\nA combination of fields in an array. For example:\non: [ \"date\", \"customerId\" ]\nThe order of the fields in the array does not matter, and you cannot specify the same field multiple times.\nFor the specified field or fields:\nThe aggregation results documents must contain the field(s) specified in the on, unless the on field is the _id\nfield. If the _id field is missing from a results document, MongoDB adds it automatically.\nThe specified field or fields cannot contain a null or an array value.\n$merge requires a unique, index with keys that correspond to the on identifier fields. Although the order of the\nindex key specification does not matter, the unique index must only contain the on fields as its keys.\nThe index must also have the same collation as the aggregation’s collation.\nThe unique index can be a sparse index.\nFor output collections that already exist, the corresponding index must already exist.\nThe default value for on depends on the output collection:\nIf the output collection does not exist, the on identifier must be and defaults to the _id field. The\ncorresponding unique _id index is automatically created.\nTIP\nTo use a different on identifier field(s) for a collection that does not exist, you can create the collection\nfirst by creating a unique index on the desired field(s). See the section on non-existent output collection for\nan example.\nIf the existing output collection is unsharded, the on identifier defaults to the _id field.\nIf the existing output collection is a sharded collection, the on identifier defaults to all the shard key fields\nand the _id field. If specifying a different on identifier, the on must contain all the shard key fields.\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        whenMatched\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        whenMatched:         WhenMatchedType | StageInterface[]\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         WhenMatchedType | StageInterface[]\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    Optional. The behavior of $merge if a result document and an existing document in the collection have the same\nvalue for the specified on field(s).\nYou can specify either:\nOne of the pre-defined action strings:\nAction    Description\n“replace”\nReplace the existing document in the output collection with the matching results document.\nWhen performing a replace, the replacement document cannot result in a modification of the _id value or, if the\noutput collection is sharded, the shard key value.

documentation\n\nis a pipeline builder for the db.collection.aggregate method and db.aggregate method. It will simplify pipelines by making them more\nreadable and much easier to edit. It also allows you to test your pipelines on a dataset in order to verify them. Pipeline stages appear in an array. Documents pass\nthrough the stages in sequence.\n\n\nnpm package \n\nnpm i mongodb-pipeline-builder --save\n\nUsage:\n- with require\nconst PipelineBuilder = require(\"mongodb-pipeline-builder\").PipelineBuilder;\nconst { EqualityPayload, OnlyPayload, Field } = require('mongodb-pipeline-builder/helpers');\nconst { LessThanEqual, ArrayElemAt, Equal, Expression } = require('mongodb-pipeline-builder/operators');- with import\nimport { PipelineBuilder } from 'mongodb-pipeline-builder';\nimport { EqualityPayload, OnlyPayload, Field } from 'mongodb-pipeline-builder/helpers';\nimport { LessThanEqual, ArrayElemAt, Equal, Expression } from 'mongodb-pipeline-builder/operators';Example with paging:\nconst myNewPipeline = new PipelineBuilder( 'myPagination', { debug: true } )\n    .Match( Expression( LessThanEqual( '$id', 20 ) ) )\n    .Project( OnlyPayload( 'name', 'weight' ) )\n    .Paging( 5, 3 ) // 5 per page, page 3\n    .getPipeline();is equivalent to:\nconst myNewPipeline = [ {\n    $facet: {\n        docs: [\n            { $match: { $expr: { $lte: [\"$id\", 20] } } },\n            { $project: { _id: 0, name: 1, weight: 1 } },\n            { $skip: 10 },\n            { $limit: 5 }\n        ],\n        count: [\n            { $match: { $expr: { $lte: [\"$id\", 20] } } },\n            { $project: { _id: 0, name: 1, weight: 1 } },\n            { $count: \"totalElements\" }\n        ]\n    }\n} ];Example without paging:\nconst myNewPipeline = new PipelineBuilder('user-skills')\n    .Match(Expression(Equal('$id', 123456)))\n    .Lookup(EqualityPayload('profiles', 'profile', 'profileId', 'id'))\n    .Project(OnlyPayload('firstname', 'lastname', 'email'))\n    .AddFields(\n        Field('skills', ArrayElemAt('$profile.skills', 0)),\n        Field('availability', ArrayElemAt('$profile.availability', 0))\n    )\n    .Unset('profile')\n    .getPipeline();is equivalent to:\nconst myNewPipeline = [\n    { $match: { $expr: { $eq: [\"$id\", 123456] } } },\n    { $lookup: { from: \"profiles\", as: \"profile\", localField: \"profileId\", foreignField: \"id\" } },\n    { $project: { _id: 0, firstname: 1, lastname: 1, email: 1 } },\n    { $addFields: {\n        skills: { $arrayElemAt: [\"$profile.skills\", 0] },\n        availability: { $arrayElemAt: [\"$profile.availability\", 0] }\n    } },\n    { $unset: \"profile\" }\n];\nGetResult()\n\nis an asynchronous method that provides a very easy way to use your aggregation pipelines on a target (collection or mongoose model having the aggregation method) with or without paging.\nThen you will have access to:\n  - GetDocs() to get the documents found.\n  - GetCount() to get the total number of documents found. Often useful when paging with partial results.\n\n\nExample :\nconst result = await GetResult( target, pipeline );\nresult.GetDocs();\nresult.GetCount();Or :\nGetResult( target, pipeline ).then( result => {\n    result.GetDocs();\n    result.GetCount();\n} );\n[ Try the lib on NPM RunKit with the require method ]\n[ Aggregation Pipeline Stages ]\n\nMONGODB STAGES:\n\nAddFields | Bucket | BucketAuto | CollStats | Count | Facet | GeoNear | GraphLookup | Group | IndexStats | Limit | ListSessions | Lookup | Match | Merge | Out | PlanCacheStats | Project | Redact | ReplaceRoot | ReplaceWith | Sample | Search | Set | Skip | Sort | SortByCount | UnionWith | Unset | Unwind\n\n\nCUSTOM STAGE:\n\nPaging\n\n\n\n[ Aggregation Pipeline Helpers ]\n\nSTAGE HELPERS * :\n\n - Bucket ( GroupByPayload )\n - BucketAuto ( GroupByAutoPayload )\n - CurrentOp ( OpPayload )\n - GeoNear ( NearPayload )\n - Lookup ( ConditionPayload | EqualityPayload )\n - Merge ( IntoPayload )\n - Out ( DbCollPayload )\n - Project ( IgnorePayload | OnlyPayload )\n - Sample ( SizePayload )\n - UnionWith ( CollectionPayload )\n\nCOMMON HELPERS:\n\n - Field >> AddFields( Field ** ) | Set( Field ** ) | Sort( Field ** )\n - List\n\n* If no helper is available for a stage, use stage method and pass it a valid value as a parameter.\n** One or more separated by a comma.\n\n\n[ Aggregation Pipeline Operators ]\n\n\nAbsolute | Accumulator | Acos | Acosh | Add | AddToSet | AllElementsTrue | And | AnyElementTrue | ArrayElemAt | ArrayToObject | Asin | Asinh | Atan | Atan2 | Atanh | Avg | BinarySize | BsonSize | Ceil | Compare | Concat | ConcatArrays | Cond | Convert | Cos | Cosh | DateFromParts | DateFromString | DateToParts | DateToString | DayOfMonth | DayOfWeek | DayOfYear | DegreesToRadians | Divide | Equal | Exponent | Expression | Filter | First | Floor | FunctionOperator | GreaterThan | GreaterThanEqual | Hour | IfNull | In | IndexOfArray | IndexOfBytes | IndexOfCP | IsArray | IsNumber | IsoDayOfWeek | IsoWeek | IsoWeekYear | Last | LessThan | LessThanEqual | Let | Literal | Log | Log10 | Ltrim | MapOperator | Max | MergeObjects | Meta | Millisecond | Min | Minute | Mod | Month | Multiply | NaturalLog | Not | NotEqual | ObjectToArray | Or | Pow | Push | RadiansToDegrees | Rand | Range | Reduce | RegexFind | RegexFindAll | RegexMatch | ReplaceAll | ReplaceOne | ReverseArray | Round | Rtrim | SampleRate | Second | SetDifference | SetEquals | SetIntersection | SetIsSubset | SetUnion | Sin | Sinh | Size | Slice | Split | Sqrt | StdDevPop | StdDevSamp | StrCaseCmp | StrLenBytes | StrLenCP | Substr | SubstrBytes | SubstrCP | Subtract | Sum | Switch | Tan | Tanh | ToBool | ToDate | ToDecimal | ToDouble | ToInt | ToLong | ToLower | ToObjectId | ToString | ToUpper | Trim | Trunc | Type | Week | Year | Zip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2021 Mickael Nodanche\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
